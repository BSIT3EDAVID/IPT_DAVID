            <p>Hello! I'm Karlvic David, a motivated student pursuing my passion for Information Technology with a focus on web development. I am eager to learn and grow through various projects and experiences, both in the classroom and in practical applications. My studies have equipped me with valuable skills in areas such as front-end and back-end development, responsive design, and user experience. I believe in the power of technology to create engaging and functional web applications, and I look forward to connecting with others to explore collaborative opportunities!</p>
